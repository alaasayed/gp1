== Birth and education ==
Ahmed Hassan Zewail, was born on February 26, 1946 in Damanhour, Kingdom of Egypt or Egypt and was raised in Desouk.http://gate.ahram.org.eg/Malafat/50/342/أحمد-زويل--نشأته-وتعليمه-.aspx أحمد زويل - نشأته وتعليمه] Al-Ahram, 9 Dec. 2012.His father Hassan assembled bicycles and motorcycles and later became a government official. His parents stayed married for 50 years, till the death of his father in October 22, 1992.cite book or last=Zewail or first=Ahmed or title=Voyage Through Time or year=2002 or publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. or location=Singapore or pages=287
He received a bachelors and an MS degree in Chemistry from the Alexandria University before moving to the United States to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with advisor Robin M. Hochstrasser.He later completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley with advisor Charles Bonner Harris or Charles B.

== Academic career ==
After completing his post doctoral work at UC-Berkeley, he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976, where he has remained since 1990, he was made the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics.He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1982.

Zewail has been nominated and will participate in President Barack Obamas United States Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology or Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology  an advisory group of the nations leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.cite web or title=President Obama Announces Members of Science and Technology Advisory Council or  or publisher=The White House or accessdate=12 February 2011 or  archive or  archivedate= 12 February 2011  dead or title=Press Release: The 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry or  or publisher=Nobelprize.org or accessdate=12 February 2011
His work started with the question, how fast did the energy within an isolated large molecule like naphthalene redistribute among all the atomic motions?  They had to build an apparatus with a vacuum chamber for molecules coming out of the source as a collimated beam at supersonic speed.  The challenge was to build an ultrafast laser to be used with the molecular beam.  The beam and the picosecond laser system were interfaced.  The goal of the project began as wanting to directly measure the rate of vibrational-energy redistribution for an isolated molecule using the picosecond laser.

They wanted to see the process from birth to death of a molecule.  In this experiment the isolated anthracene molecule was unexpected and contrary to popular wisdom.  During redistribution the population was oscillating coherently back and forth.  There was no decay, but there was rebirth and all molecules moved coherently in a phase.  In a large molecule, each vibrational motion is like a pendulum, but there are many motions because a molecules has many atoms.  If the motions were not coherent, the observation would have been much different.

The results of this experiment revealed the significance of coherence and its existence in complex molecular systems.  The finding of coherence were significant because it showed that through the expected chaotic motions in molecules, ordered motion can be found, despite the presence of a "heat sink", which can destroy coherence and drain energy.  Coherence in molecules had not been observed before not because of a lack of coherence, but because of a lack of proper probes.  In the anthracene experiments, time and energy resolutions were introduced and correlated.

Though Zewail continued studies on vibrational-energy redistributions, he started new studies on shorter time resolutions for molecules showing different chemical processes and rotational motions.
===Awards and Honours===

In 1999, Zewail became the third Egyptians or Egyptian national to receive the Nobel Prize. Zewail gave his Nobel Lecture on "Femtochemistry: Atomic-Scale Dynamics of the Chemical Bond Using Ultrafast Lasers".cite web or title=Angewandte Chemie International Edition  Vol 39 Issue 15 or  or website=Wiley Online Library or accessdate=7 March 2015His prize was following Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat  Naguib Mahfouz  Mohamed ElBaradei followed him  Other international awards include the Wolf Prize in Chemistry awarded to him by the Wolf Foundation, the Tolman Medal  the Robert A.

Zewail was awarded an honorary doctorate by Lund University in Sweden in May 2003 and is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. University of Cambridge or Cambridge University awarded him an Honorary degree or honorary Doctor of Science in 2006. In October 2006, Zewail received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science for his pioneering development of the new field femtoscience and for his seminal contributions to the revolutionary discipline of physical biology, creating new ways for better understanding the functional behavior of biological systems by directly visualizing them in the four dimensions of space and time.cite web or title=Albert Einstein World Award of Science 2006 or  or accessdate=August 13, 2013In May 2008, Zewail received an honorary doctorate from Complutense University of Madrid.

== Political work ==
In June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, Elias Zerhouni, and Bruce Alberts became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html America.gov]
When asked about rumors that he might contest the Egyptian presidential election, 2011 or 2011 Egyptian presidential election, Ahmed Zewail said: "I am a frank man I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist."http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=133290 Zewail: I have no political ambitions ..

During the 2011 Egyptian protests he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside Ayman Nour, Mubaraks rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.cite news  or title=EGYPT: ZEWAIL RETURNS, CREDIBLE POST-MUBARAK FIGURE  or author=ANSAmed  or  or newspaper=ANSAmed  or date=1 February 2011  or accessdate=5 February 2011Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubaraks resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the April 6 Youth Movement and young supporters of Mohamed ElBaradei.cite news or last=Fahim or first=Kareem or title=Military Offers Assurances to Egypt and Neighbors or  or accessdate=12 February 2011 or newspaper=The New York Times or date=February 12, 2011 or author2=Kirkpatrick, David D. or  archive or  archivedate= 13 February 2011  dead or title=Technology’s Promise, Humanity’s Future or  or website=University of California Television or accessdate=7 March 2015cite web or title=Technology’s Promise, Humanity’s Future or  or website=Walter H.

== Zewail City land dispute case ==
Nile University has been fighting with Zewail City of Science and Technology, established by Nobel laureate Ahmed Zewail, for more than two years over a piece of land that both universities claim to be their own.

A March 22, 2014 ruling turned down challenges to a verdict issued in April 2013 submitted by Zewail City. The court also ruled in favour of the return of Nile University students to the contested buildings.

In a statement released by Nile University’s Student Union before Saturday’s decision, the students stated that the verdict would test the current government’s respect to the judiciary and its rulings.

Zewail City, meanwhile, stressed in a statement released on Saturday that the recent verdict rules on an urgent level; the substantive level of the case is yet to be ruled on. Sherif Fouad, Zewail City’s spokesman and media adviser, said the verdict “adds nothing new.” It is impossible for Zewail City to implement Saturday’s verdict and take Nile University students into the buildings currently occupied by Zewail City students, he said.ttp://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/22/supreme-administrative-court-upholds-nile-universitys-claim-contested-land/
