'''Ahmed Hassan Zewail''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد حسن زويل}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈæħmæd ˈħæsæn zeˈweːl|IPA}}; born February 26, 1946) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] scientist, known as the "father of [[femtochemistry]]", he won the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]<nowiki/> and became the first Egyptian scientist to win a [[Nobel Prize]] in a scientific field. He is the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Centre for Ultrafast Science and Technology ([http://ust.caltech.edu/ UST])<ref>[http://ust.caltech.edu/ The Physical Biology Centre for Ultrafast Science and Technology (UST) website.]</ref> at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

== Birth and education ==
Ahmed Hassan Zewail, was born on February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and was raised in [[Desouk]].<ref>[http://gate.ahram.org.eg/Malafat/50/342/أحمد-زويل--نشأته-وتعليمه-.aspx أحمد زويل - نشأته وتعليمه] [[Al-Ahram]], 9 Dec. 2012.</ref> His father Hassan assembled bicycles and motorcycles and later became a government official. His parents stayed married for 50 years, till the death of his father in October 22, 1992.<ref name="Zewail 2002 287">{{cite book|last=Zewail|first=Ahmed|title=Voyage Through Time|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.|location=Singapore|pages=287}}</ref>

He received a bachelor's and an MS degree in Chemistry from the [[Alexandria University]] before moving to the United States to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with advisor [[Robin M. Hochstrasser]].<ref name="Zewail 2002 287"/>
He later completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with advisor [[Charles Bonner Harris|Charles B. Harris]].<ref name="autobio">{{cite web|last=Zewail|first=Ahmed|title=Autobiography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1999/zewail-autobio.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref>

== Academic career ==
After completing his post doctoral work at [[UC-Berkeley]], he was awarded a faculty appointment at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1976, where he has remained since 1990, he was made the first [[Linus Pauling]] Chair in Chemical Physics.<ref name="autobio"/> He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1982.

Zewail has been nominated and will participate in President Barack Obama's [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST), an advisory group of the nation's leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|title=President Obama Announces Members of Science and Technology Advisory Council|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Members-of-Science-and-Technology-Advisory-Council/|publisher=The White House|accessdate=12 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110212200815/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Members-of-Science-and-Technology-Advisory-Council/| archivedate= 12 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Research ===

Zewail's key work has been as a pioneer of [[femtochemistry]]—i.e. the study of [[chemical reaction]]s across [[femtosecond]]s. Using a rapid [[ultrafast]] [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales - short enough to analyse [[transition state]]s in selected chemical reactions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: The 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1999/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref>

His work started with the question, how fast did the energy within an isolated large molecule like [[naphthalene]] redistribute among all the atomic motions?  They had to build an apparatus with a vacuum chamber for molecules coming out of the source as a collimated beam at supersonic speed.  The challenge was to build an ultrafast laser to be used with the molecular beam.  The beam and the picosecond laser system were interfaced.  The goal of the project began as wanting to directly measure the rate of vibrational-energy redistribution for an isolated molecule using the picosecond laser.

They wanted to see the process from birth to death of a molecule.  In this experiment the isolated [[anthracene]] molecule was unexpected and contrary to popular wisdom.  During redistribution the population was oscillating coherently back and forth.  There was no decay, but there was rebirth and all molecules moved coherently in a phase.  In a large molecule, each vibrational motion is like a pendulum, but there are many motions because a molecules has many atoms.  If the motions were not coherent, the observation would have been much different.

The results of this experiment revealed the significance of coherence and its existence in complex molecular systems.  The finding of coherence were significant because it showed that through the expected chaotic motions in molecules, ordered motion can be found, despite the presence of a "heat sink", which can destroy coherence and drain energy.  Coherence in molecules had not been observed before not because of a lack of coherence, but because of a lack of proper probes.  In the anthracene experiments, time and energy resolutions were introduced and correlated.

Though Zewail continued studies on vibrational-energy redistributions, he started new studies on shorter time resolutions for molecules showing different chemical processes and rotational motions.<ref name="Zewail 2002 287"/>

== Political work ==
In June 4, 2009 speech at [[Cairo University]], US President [[Barack Obama]] announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, [[Elias Zerhouni]], and [[Bruce Alberts]] became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.<ref>[http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html America.gov]</ref>

When asked about rumors that he might contest the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|2011 Egyptian presidential election]], Ahmed Zewail said: "I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist."<ref name="Zewail: I have no political ambitions .. I would like service of Egypt a scientist only">[http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=133290 Zewail: I have no political ambitions .. I would like service of Egypt a scientist only]</ref>

During the [[2011 Egyptian protests]] he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside [[Ayman Nour]], Mubarak's rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.<ref>{{cite news |title=EGYPT: ZEWAIL RETURNS, CREDIBLE POST-MUBARAK FIGURE |author=[[ANSAmed]] |url=http://www.ansamed.info/en/egitto/news/ME.XEF12253.html |newspaper=[[ANSAmed]] |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref>
Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak's resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the [[April 6 Youth Movement]] and young supporters of [[Mohamed ElBaradei]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Fahim|first=Kareem|title=Military Offers Assurances to Egypt and Neighbors|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/world/middleeast/13egypt.html|accessdate=12 February 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 12, 2011|author2=Kirkpatrick, David D.| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110213135816/http://www.nytimes.com//2011//02//13//world//middleeast//13egypt.html| archivedate= 13 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In November 2012 Zewail discussed "Technology’s Promise, Humanity’s Future” at UCSB Campbell Hall in Isla Vista, California. <ref>{{cite web|title=Technology’s Promise, Humanity’s Future|url=http://www.uctv.tv/shows/Technologys-Promise-Humanitys-Future-24776|website=University of California Television|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Technology’s Promise, Humanity’s Future|url=http://www.cappscenter.ucsb.edu/news/upcoming-event-calendar/|website=Walter H.

== Zewail City land dispute case ==
Nile University has been fighting with Zewail City of Science and Technology, established by Nobel laureate Ahmed Zewail, for more than two years over a piece of land that both universities claim to be their own.

A March 22, 2014 ruling turned down challenges to a verdict issued in April 2013 submitted by Zewail City. The court also ruled in favour of the return of Nile University students to the contested buildings.

In a statement released by Nile University’s Student Union before Saturday’s decision, the students stated that the verdict would test the current government’s respect to the judiciary and its rulings.

Zewail City, meanwhile, stressed in a statement released on Saturday that the recent verdict rules on an urgent level; the substantive level of the case is yet to be ruled on. Sherif Fouad, Zewail City’s spokesman and media adviser, said the verdict “adds nothing new.” It is impossible for Zewail City to implement Saturday’s verdict and take Nile University students into the buildings currently occupied by Zewail City students, he said.<ref>http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/03/22/supreme-administrative-court-upholds-nile-universitys-claim-contested-land/</ref>
